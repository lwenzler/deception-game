# Deception game

This repository contains the deception-game experiment. This game was created as a replication of the first experiment from the original study by Ransom et. al. 2019. The authors of this version of the game are Dario Hol Kieslich, Jana Schapka, Emily Seitz and Lara Wenzler.

## Online demo

The original study to our replication made our research possible:

Ransom, K., Voorspoels, W., Navarro, D., & Perfors, A. (2019, October 2). Where the truth lies:
